To compile FeatherNotes from its source, first install build dependencies. In Debian-based systems, they are:

 * g++ >= 5
 * libx11-dev and libxext-dev (for X11)
 * qtbase5-dev and libqt5x11extras5-dev (for Qt5)
 * libqt5svg5-dev (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qttools5-dev-tools (for localization)
 * libhunspell-dev (optional, for spell checking)

In Arch-based systems, the required package are:

 * gcc (or gcc-multilib for multilib systems)
 * libx11 and libxext (for X11)
 * qt5-base and qt5-x11extras (for Qt5)
 * qt5-svg (for hard-coded SVG icons)
 * qt5-tools (for localization)
 * hunspell (optional, for spell checking)

In Red Hat based systems like Fedora:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * qt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * qt5-qtbase-devel
 * qt5-qtsvg-devel
 * qt5-qttools-devel
 * hunspell-devel (optional, for spell checking)

And, finally, in OpenSUSE:

 * gcc-c++
 * libX11-devel
 * libXext-devel
 * libqt5-qtx11extras-devel
 * libqt5-qtbase-devel
 * libqt5-qtsvg-devel
 * libqt5-qttools-devel
 * hunspell-devel (optional, for spell checking)

Then, open a terminal inside this folder and issue the following commands:

	qmake && make
	sudo make install

If your default Qt installation is not Qt5, put the full path of Qt5 qmake in the first command but before that, put the full path of Qt5's "lrelease" binary into 'feathernotes/feathernotes.pro' (only one place).

Afterward, you could use this command for cleaning the source directory:

	make distclean

*********************************
*   Compilation with Hunspell   *
*********************************

Under Linux and Unix, FeatherNotes supports spell checking with Hunspell if it is compiled with:

	qmake WITH_HUNSPELL=YES
	make

See above for the build dependency.

*******************************
*   Compilation without X11   *
*******************************

If you do not want the X11 support, you could compile FeatherNotes with:

	qmake WITHOUT_X11=YES
	make

The result will have all features except for virtual desktop awareness.

Please also note that, on Linux, FeatherNotes works under Wayland and you do not need to disable its X11 support for that.

Compilation on macOS does not require "WITHOUT_X11=YES" either.

**********************************
*   Translation (Localization)   *
**********************************

The file 'feathernotes/data/translations/feathernotes.ts' can serve as the basis for translation. The translated file should be saved in the same directory as "feathernotes_LN.ts", where "LN" is the abbreviation for the target language, like "de", "fr", etc.

If you have translated FeatherNotes's GUI into your language, please make a "Pull Request" (PR) at https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherNotes for your work to be merged into FeatherNotes!
